# StockPlotter
Program that plots a few different sets of stock info I have gathered from an IFTTT routine.

This program works pretty specifically with a particular set of data that I have on my google
drive. It contains about a year of closing price data for Tesla and Amazon that was collected
via a IFTTT routine. If anyone wants access to that data, let me know and I will send it.
